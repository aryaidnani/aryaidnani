          This webpage started as merely a countdown to my birthday, but has
          become for me personally much much more. The years 2022 and 2023 have
          been the hardest ones on me yet, not just because of my own lack of
          effort, but also because of the people around me. Let it be friends,
          certain relatives, relationships or even those whom I intentionally
          let my guard down around, thinking they were mine. At the same time,
          it is for those select few people I can count on my fingers who were
          there for me no matter what. This page is a public
          <strong>fuck you</strong> to those who wronged me and very well know
          who they are and what they did, and a record set in the ink of the
          internet for everyone to know, that <em>Arya Idnani</em> is a force of
          nature.
