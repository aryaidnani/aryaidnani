    content: `<p>So yes, today is the day I restart my 100 days of code challenge. The last time I tried to complete this challenge, it ended on day 51. This delivered a huge blow to me. It took me 3 days to get over this in order to start today. So now my challenge gets over on the 20<sup>th</sup> of December. This isn't ideal but sadly thats the way everything is. Ocassionally we all have and will have our share of bad days, it is our response and outlook towards the situation which matter. Growth surely involves minimalization of pitfalls, but whats equally important is learning how to deal with them. By no means am I trying to fend for my broken streak of 50 days, but I have come to realise that, our reaction to such hard situations is what matters most. <br> <br>
    So here I am, after 3 days of regret and brooding, writing this blog after having done some coding today. Today I implemented the option to toggle between light and dark mode on my page. This is cool and I will be trying to learn more about responsive web pages today. I am restarting this challenge with the hope of being able to rebuild my lost momentum, and regain the confidence coding once gave me. </p>`,

    content: `<p>Today was a decently productive day. I managed to learn a little more about responsive web pages and also managed to make this website slightly more responsive. I did this by changing the hardcoded pixel values of elements to rem values. This took some time but the good part was the fact that I was able to balance this with meeting guests who came home for ganpati. Not only did I manage to interact with guests, but also managed to get my work done. On any other day I would've wanted to do more, but considering today's day coupled with college, I'm happy I was able to add/modify this part of my website.</p>`,

    content: `<p>Well this was overwhelming to say the least. Today I attended my weekend Javascript class which was quite overwhelming. Why?Because today we started off with databases, mongodb to be specific. Every part of mongodb, for me atleast was a pain to say the least. Right from configuring mongodb's compass to creating a cluster to even updating it using CRUD, this was quite quite overwhelming. Databases are the next step for this website so I really want to learn them, but at the same time I need to do so slowly.<br><br> There is a clear miss match between what I have learnt through resources on the internet & what I have learnt through this weekend course. Now I need to bridge that gap because both these learning pathways are moving at a different pace. I can learn online however I want and whenever I want, but my weekend class is pretty fast. It is fast because the instructor teaches main concepts over the weekends and expects us to learn more about the subject over the week. Its been 8 weeks and its high time I bridge the gap.This is something I need to figure out, and figure out soon because my college starts in full flow from the coming week. Here's to figuring it out!! </p>`,

    content: `<p>A great day indeed. Today I had an event in college (treasure hunt) which I participated in along with my friends and boy did we have a blast. We also got assigned a senior to guide us during the event and to keep a check on us, and she was so nice to us. She was pretty disinterested in the beginning, but somehow our enthusiasum got to her and by the end she was laughing and having fun just like the three of us were. We couldn't win the thing however running up and down the college, seeing our senior laugh with us, and in general just having fun was what mattered to me. <br><br> After getting home I got some sleep and sat for my Javascript class. Today was a continuation of Mongodb and again, todays class was super interesting. I learnt about hashing, salting, input validation etc using libraries like bcrypt and zod. Again this was a pretty heavy lecture, but one which I really found myself invested in. I then proceeded to learn some terminal commands, using vim and so on. Soon after that I fixed the alignment of elements in the navbar. This was an issue because I recently changed most of the hardcoded pixel values of my page to rem values. As a result of this, it affected the alignment of elements and their sizes. I fixed the obvious ones when I introduced rem, but some minor ones are yet to be fixed. <br>That was a brief summary of today and I'm really really looking forward to maximizing tomorrow.</p>`,

    content: `<p>By far the most productive day since I have restarted my streak. Today I managed to finish a decent part of backlog I had in my Javascript weekend class. The focus of these topics was middlewares and http servers. I have never understood these topics as well as I did today and I'm so glad I did. I also wanted to sort've start with authentication but that will take some time. Anyways I managed to get a hang of these topics fairly well and tried implementing them on a local clone of this website. For some reason I am not able to import the express library, but am trying to figure out why. Other than that you can probably tell I'm very happy with today.<br><br> What makes me happier is the fact that I got my class roll number and it is the most apt number any developer could hope for. It is (drumroll) 64!!!!. This number is drilled into anyone who's into development, tech or both. 64 bit, base 64, 64gb and the list goes on. Couldn't be happier with today's progress and I can't wait to maximise tomorrow.</p>`,

The blog of Day 4 has a little about you and might make you smile (nothing you don't already know) but still.<br><br>Coming to today's work, it was pretty decent. I couldn't manage to see the lectures I planned to but I implemented something I've been wanting to for a while. So I added a text container on the landing page which displays a new quote each time someone visits the site. I added this by using an api and by destructuring the JSON content it returned to me. Doing so also introduced concepts like ajax and jquery to me which are important and I'm happy that I was able to use them a bit. Other than that I'm happy with what I did today and like I said yesterday, can't wait to maximise tomorrow. Akshita seriously call me ;)</p>`,

    content: `<p>LETS FUCKING GOOO BOYSSS!!! I really shouldn't be starting a public blog on the internet like this but no other quote can captivate my feelings as effectively as this one. Today was a mad mad rollercoaster. I practically coded all day, not just lectures, not just an assignment, but BOTH. Today's probably the 3<sup>rd</sup> day in a row that I've been doing middlewares, and I'm so happy I did. I finally finished all lectures on middlewares and can now say confidently that I have a decent understanding of the express library. I can say this because for the past 3 days I've read documentation from all parts of the internet, tried a bunch of things, failed at many, but also figured what's the problem and what's the most apt way to fix them.<br><br> The eureka moment came today when I learnt about this forbidden technique called CORS (Cross origin resource sharing). The technique basically means connecting resources on different domains/IP's like a frontend and backend hosted separately on two separate domains. I will not dive into detail because then I can keep going on and on, but it was learning about this technique which fueled me for the rest of the day and really made me appreciate the intricacy of systems we so frequently take for granted. By no means am I a master of this subject (yet), but I feel that I can (and have today) appreciate it properly.<br><br> If you thought that was the best part of today, it was barely 30%!. I spent the rest of my day trying to build the backend of a todo app. Yes a todo app is one of the most basic projects any beginner can and is expected to code without hesitation, but my instructor added a challenge for all of us. He asked us to store the TODO's as JSON objects, not in a database (because we haven't learnt them properly) but on a file, a file part of (if I'm saying this correctly) temporary memory which gets loaded/created when the server is started. This memory doesn't get stored forever (like memory in a database) and resets itself everytime the runtime environment (nodejs in my case) is restarted. This was tricky and even the instructor told us that it is slightly hard, but somehow I managed to pull it off. Now each time I add a TODO (using a post request method) a TODO with its own ID gets added as an object to the array of TODO objects, and each time I delete a TODO, not only does the TODO get deleted, but all TODO's renumber their ID's to maintain simplicity.<br><br> I am particularly proud of this because it's only been a few days since I started practicing node.js properly, and managed to write all this code (even though it is relatively straight-forward) on my own, without the help of any tutorial. Ever since I restarted my streak (and I know I have said this a bunch of times now) I have never felt this happy. This is due to the fact that when I started my previous streak, I was starting from scratch. So no matter what I did, each day was exciting. Ever since I've had to restart my streak, it hasn't been the same, because I have already built a foundation and to get the same adrenaline hit I need to do significantly more than my counterpart streak.<br><br> It's only been a week and I'm already so happy. Arya Idnani you better pull this off this time and complete this challenge on a high high high FUCKING NOTE!</p>`,

    content: `<p>Today's day was another banger. It was the first day for many students at college (because admissions just got over), so saw many new faces, found some friends from highschool and in general the day was off to a good start. This start was taken to rollercoaster mode when our senior (roohin) approached us and asked us if we'd be interested in participating in an event. Given the fact that our coming lectures of the day were cancelled, we decided to sign up, and boy did we have a blast. Again we couldn't qualify but we had so much of fun. Thank you once again Roohin if you're reading this, we all relished every second of it. <br><br>Coming back to business, today I started a topic I've always had on my bucket list, AUTHENTICATION. I learnt about token (stateful) authentication and JWT (stateless) authentication. This was very fun and surprisingly I was able to digest the concepts well even though I had a jam packed day. Although a concerning point to note is the fact that JWT's can easily be decoded. This is ironic given the fact that they're used for storing authentication information. My instructor has assured us though that he will tell us why JWT's work inspite of this so called vulnerability.  Over the week-end I will be reviewing all the concepts I've learnt over the week and will definitely give JWT's another shot to better understand them. That's another day, and honestly the momentum is coming alive, I can feel it.</p>`,

    content: `<p>Not the day I wanted it to be. Given the momentum I had gained over the past few days having understood authentication, cors etc etc, I expected today's productivity to be decent. It wasn't however. Today I was going to learn a little more about JWT's, how they are actually secure and not an issue, but for some reason wasn't able to code last class' assignment. To be specific my code wasn't able to handle an error case. It handled the successful case properly, but for any code to even be considered as accomplishing the task, it should be able to handle all cases, optimisations come much after. I'm still trying to wrap my head around what the issue can be, but really don't know where to look.<br><br> I did however write code on paper in college today. So we had this boring "professional communication ethics" lecture, which I literally would've dozed off in had it not been for the code I was writing. The teacher probably thought I was making notes, little did she know I was coding. In my defense I paid attention to the lecture as well. When we were asked to write a summary of the lecture, our teacher was pretty impressed with my summary and complimented me. So once again, not the best day, but I hope I can pick things up from here over the coming weekend.</p>`,

    content: `<p>Today was yet again a rocky day. Being a Saturday, I looked forward to making the most out of today, but sadly I didn't start work before 7pm. I tried building a Viewer Counting function which would keep track of traffic. Now this sounds easy in principal, but it isn't (atleast for a beginner). Especially not when you want to deploy it on the internet. The biggest difficulty I faced was with CORS, a concept I thought I understood. Somehow, by a lot of tedious permutation and combination I was able to make this work locally, but when I pushed this to deployment using vercel, it just wouldn't work.If I were to list all the issues I ran into or the number of commits I made thinking that was it, this blog would never get over. So yeah couldn't get much out of the day in terms of quantity but I am now well aware of the areas I need to work hard on.<br><br> But some good did come out of this unproductive day. So someone from my college was looking for a team-mate to participate with in an upcoming hackathon. On reaching out to her, I'm now part of a group of 4 first year students, revving up to code to the best of our abilities in the upcoming hackathon. I pray to god that we're able to work well together as a team and live up to each others expectations.</p>`,

    content: `<p>Yet another rocky day. Given the fact that I was having a fair share of unproductive days lately, I woke up thinking that I'll maximise today, sadly I couldn't. This wasn't due to lack of trying, but mainly because I literally hit a dead-end. Yesterday I tried deploying the older version of my website using vercel, this was so that I can run a node js server on vercel in order to carry out any backend requests like keeping a track of user requests. Sadly I wasn't able to figure this out yesterday, and neither was I able to today. I did come a lot closer though, but then again dead-end. This really puts into perspective on how much I need to learn and push myself.<br><br> I did however manage to get some work today. This involved setting up a frontend page for the backend authentication script I had written in express. This worked once I set up CORS correctly and wasn't a problem. I then secured my API keys which were previously publicly visible to anyone who checked my github repository out. I was well aware of this vulnerability ever since I deployed the quotes API, but back then storing API keys in environment variables was challenging to me. This was because I was trying to do this using the dotenv library, which only works on nodejs and not on browsers. This again goes to show how much I need to learn in node js. Eventually out of frustration I chat gpt'd the solution, and implemented it. Again the AI generated solution had its quirks and I was happy to be able to fix them.<br><br>With that being said, I am officially at the end of my Javascript class backlog, so hopefully if I play my cards right from now on, I won't create newer backlogs, and hopefully push myself more from now onwards.</p>`,

    content: `<p>A right step in the right direction, is the best way to describe today. I slept early the previous day around 9pm in order to get up at 4, and thankfully I was able to. I then coded from 4:30am to roughly 5:45am for about 75 minutes, and got my basics about mongodb clear. Given the fact that about a week ago I found mongodb overwhelming, today's progress was just what I needed. I'm yet to figure how to store tokens by updating the database, but for some reason am only able to add new tokens instead of updating existing ones which is ideal. I'll try figuring this out today and more importantly aim to get up tomorrow as well and try to code for longer tomorrow.</p>`,

    content: `<p>What a day, what a day indeed. One year ago, it was on this very day that I went through one of my mental breakdowns. I was completely torn and my willpower was shattered. But here I am one year later, getting up at 4am once again like yesterday, coding in the morning and after college, being able to get over my past. A past which has taken everything away from me, a past which I can finally breathe a sigh of relief about. <br><br>Even though I slept at 11pm yesterday, I still managed to get up at 4am and learn about bcrypt and zod. These were libraries I had touched upon when I was introduced to mongodb, but it was today that I was able to better understand them. The highlight of was not just the better position I am in, contrary to last year, but it was in partially setting up the backend of my blog site. I linked a mongodb database to my backend, created a function to post blogs using post request methods and modified that method to seed my database with all these blogs in just one single click! Yes one request was all it took to seed my database completely. Instead of simply copy-pasting, I iterated over an array of objects with blog data, and in each iteration I added data to my database. Even though this is a simple and straightforward approach, given my history with mongodb, I was happy it worked just right on the first try.<br><br> Arya Idnani you've made it this far, you've come from a place of despair, heartbreak, from being wronged, cheated and left behind to building yourself from scratch, learning how to say a NO to people and to catching up to your peers, realising your self worth and the very potential it stems from. No one can comprehend what I've been through and it is with utmost pride that I'm writing this blog. Never could I have imagined such a miraculous change in circumstances, one in which I feel wanted, I feel cared for and most importantly finally being able to feel a sense of purpose , the motivation AND action to fulfill it.

    content: `<p>Today's day was also great, it was great because I was able to write a backend to talk to my database I set up yesterday, and link it to my frontend. I also managed to retrive data from my database using get request methods which I wrote in the backend file. The only problem I came across was when it came to using that data in dom manipulation. For some weird reason I wasn't able to iterate over the data and have a strange feeling that it might have something to do with its type. I'll anyways be looking into this, because once I have this figured out, my blog site will officially be a FULLSTACK application with a Frontend, Backend and Database!<br><br>This cycle of up's and downs is soo strange and day after day it becomes more obvious. I've come to realise that we often overlook it unless we keep a proper track of each day for sometime. This realisation has also prepared me for the days which aren't as productive.

    content: `<p>Days like these get thrown at me when I expect them the least. Till yesterday I was on a flying streak of good days with each day being better than the other, today however was pretty weird. Due to some miscommunication I reached college only to find out that it was cancelled. This was because of a rain alert which was issued yesterday. Our college was pre-emptive enough to share government notifications, but then they decided to keep the college working last minute and when barely anyone showed up they ended up cancelling it. This was a gut punch because thanks to it the entire first half of my day went to waste. Not just that, when I got back home I was so tired I fell asleep only to wake up in the evening.<br><br> I was determined though to keep my streak going, so given the fact that my weekend javascript class backlog was almost over, decided to learn a little about array methods, maps, filtering and reducing. These are really important methods and will be pivotal in building a strong fullstack application. Somehow I managed to do this for 2 hours, but seeing an entire day go to waste the way in which it did, really saddened me. I need to accept the fact that at some point everything will go south on me. It's much better to be prepared for the worst rather than expecting things to fall into place. It is upto me now to strengthen my ability to face the unexpected, to never falter no matter how hard the blows and to reach a level at which it all looks effortless.</p>`,

Once I'm done writing today's blog I'll try learning a little bit more about them before I call it a day, and will hopefully be able to finish the section about them by tomorrow.<br><br>A big part of today was getting anxious about not starting with react. Because as of now I'm only trying to get a hang of writing basic Javascript and am doing node, express and mongodb in the background. However this is where I need to keep calm instead of letting the fomo get to me. I should feel lucky enough to having started walking down this path in a stress free environment and I should try keeping it that way.

    content: `<p>So I finally finished all the array methods which were part of my udemy course. They were pretty helpful, but were also pretty self explanatory. They were such that mdn documentation itself seemed more than enough to get a good grasp over them. Other than that today was pretty unproductive but not because of lack of trying. I built the most simplest fullstack site possible. One which lets you sign up and then if you're signed up, looks for your username in the database and displays a welcome message. This was all done without authentication so was basically nothing. The purpose behind building something as simple as possible was to understand how to deploy fullstack applications on the internet.<br><br> To do so one needs to have a server running which the hosting service itself provides. I had tried this with an older version of my blog site, but that failed miserably. Back then no matter what I did, the browser threw a CORS error at me. This was something I didn't run into today, but for some reason my site wouldn't talk to my backend at all. This was a good sign, to know that the backend is running, but once again I found myself to be clueless. In the process of building this simple application, I also learnt how to handle body and query parameters in requests. This is something I had overlooked, but now that I was building something for a browser I had to figure it all out.
    So yes I couldn't get my end goal to run, but learnt a ton in the process. </p>`,

    content: `<p>What a day indeed. I spent most of today trying to debug how to deploy my fullstack code, but kept hitting dead ends. Thanks to these dead ends I tried all the possible ways in which I could change my code. Yesterday I switched from body requests to query and then back to body and figured how to make that work and today I switched from axios to fetch and learnt a ton about that. Unlike axios, fetch requires one to specify the request method, the body, the headers and everything you possibly can. The first time I did this, I only mentioned body and the request methods. On trying to run this locally it didn't work, which is when I stumbled on the 'applications/json' header which made it work locally. On trying to deploy to vercel, all hell brooke loose once again. On the advice of a senior I even tried from switching from vercel to aws, but that was another nightmare which didn't yield anything.<br><br>The highlight of today was when I got frustrated from all this, I decided to catch a break and drive. I was accompanied by my dad (which is mandated by law for learners) and my grandfather, and I'm so happy with how well the drive went. I drove for a whopping 79.6 kilometers which included highway driving, bridge driving, driving through traffic and avoiding potholes on the way. This was a superb experience and really gave me a lot of confidence. What was even more satisfying was that my dad approved of the way I drove and so did my grandfather.

This wasn't easy though, deleting a lot of stuff, reading a lot of documentation and then finally resorting to copy pasting code from documentation. To my surprise, the only reason that the code worked was because it was written in type-script. The same code didn't work in javascript, but worked like a charm when in typescript. Apparently vercel prefers typescript and not much configuration is required to run it. Finally having deployed some part of backend, I quickly added a frontend, connected it to my database, and just in time did I have a fullstack application which worked with a typescript backend.<br><br>This time however I was met with a new error, or was I. This fullstack app worked perfectly locally as expected, but when I deployed it to vercel, instead of throwing errors, it simply processed the request. This was strange because now I didn't know where to look and what to troubleshoot. Ultimately it seems like my 'body' for some reason is remaining empty, but I'll fix that tomorrow. Hopefully I'll have all this figured out and completely deployed by tomorrow and will be able to switch back to actually learning instead of troubleshooting code which in itself actually is teaching me a lot.</p>`,

Ever since yesterday, I've fallen sick with a bad cold and that restricted me more than I anticipated. I wasn't able to look at the screen for too long as my eyes would hurt because of the cold and this really held me back from getting work done today. As I couldn't go to college today, I got my bank work done which included converting minor accounts to adult accounts and applying for a credit card. All this was great and on any normal day I wouldn't be able to get this work done, but not being able to code much was a really gut punch.<br><br>I did start working on a project my instructor assigned though, to build a course selling website. So with what I had left of this day, I managed to build the backend for registering and logging in users. This was significant to me because I really hadn't understood zod and bycrpt as well as I should've. Today I used them together and managed to make my code work. Safe parse is an important method I learnt today, which is critical for using zod.

    content: `<p>A pretty decent day, not just coding wise but also health wise. Yesterday was probably the first time in my streak when my health kept me from coding, I'm happy to report that I feel much much better today. Today's day started with a call with my college friend who had a doubt related to a coding assignment. The assignment was to deteremine whether a given number is an Armstrong's number or not. A number whose sum of individual numbers, each of which is raised to the power of the total number of numbers in the number. For example in 153, the total number of numbers is 3. So if we take the sum of 1 cube, 5 cube and 3 cube, you get 153, which is why it is an Armstrong's number.<br><br>I had just woken up from my sleep and before I knew it I was helping him code this up. Before hopping onto the call I felt a little nervous because I hadn't really done much of problem solving ever since June which is when I had briefly started it with Java. I also didn't know what an Armstrong's number is, plus I had just woken up. But to my pleasant surprise, not only was I able to understand the assignment correctly, but fix my friend's code and optimise it for him. Even though it had been months since I had done problem solving, and the fact that I knew nothing about Armstrong's number, I was able to deliver. <br><br>This really lifted my spirits given how hard the past few days had been and really was what I needed. I then proceeded to write the same code myself and it worked just as expected. But the best part was being able to help my friend, and to see his assignment get solved. Later during the day I learnt about express routing as part of my course selling project, of how express provides us with a router function which can be used to better structure our code. All in all I wish I could learn a bit more about routing, but I'm happy I how todays events marked an end to my slump!</p>`,

    content: `<p>A rollercoaster, thriller, demanding, tiring yet rewarding day is the best way to put it. Well I didn't start off the day in the way I wanted to. For starters I slept late last night around 12 and was up by 4 today. This was purely intentional and let me tell you why. What lied before me today, was a day full of practical labs and events. This was because today I had my workshop class, my electronics practical and my mechanics practical. So I assumed that if there was anyway to bend the day to my will, it would only be possible with getting work done before hand. So even though I slept late last night, I purposely got up early today because I planned on writing my journals even before our teachers asked us to. My friend was kind enough to give me the content and I preferred finishing it up at home instead in class where my entire attention would be expected from me.<br><br>Before I knew it I was making myself a cup of black coffee to suppress my sleep as long as I could, because 3 hours of sleep clearly isn't enough. I finished my journal and I reached college. To my pleasant surprise our workshop assignment didn't include writing anything in the journal, only performing our jobs. While this wasn't that bad, it seemed as if my pre-emptive journal writing had gone to waste. Workshop was tiring, but what we made was something pretty cool and I can't wait to work more on it.<br><br> The next two practicals were by far the most hectic practicals I've ever been in. Electronics was fun, but confusing and even more confusing when our professor started questioning us to check how much we truly understood.Me and my friend (who happens to be my lab partner) were super comfortable in making circuits from diagrams and managed to be the first group to finish the practical with the correct results. This didn't come with any perks sadly as it only drew our professor's attention towards us. He then grilled us with both conceptual and practical questions. In restrospect they weren't that hard, but he just kept throwing them at us out of nowhere. For context, during the entire practical we were measuring the current passing through certain resistors, and when he questioned me, he suddenly asked me to determine the potential difference (voltage) between two points. Given the fact that I had been determining current all afternoon long, I was naive enough to automatically try measuring voltage that way. Thankfully our sir stopped me in time and then I was able to determine the voltage between two points. Even though I was taken off guard for a couple of seconds when this happened, I was lucky enough to score 3 out of 4, even though I could've easily scored full.<br><br> The next part included mechanics lab which was fun but tedious, learnt about beams and load balancing, and I was able to make my measurements within a permissible error of 2.2%. I then proceeded to the student's lounge in which students were performing, singing, dancing, kind of a mini event and the vibe in there was super rewarding after such a hectic day. Hung out there for around an hour and then I made a move home. Drove after coming home and the drive was also pretty smooth. After getting back home I solved a friend's coding doubt regarding a password generator and even brushed through my concepts in the process. Because it was too late to start with my usual coding work, I chose to finish my college coding assignments. This was pretty easy and I managed to finish them in under half an hour.<br><br>Make note, at this point I'm still only on 3 hours of sleep, one cup of black coffee, and just pure willpower. I know that none of this is ideal and is very harmful to my health, but hold on a second, all this is coming from a boy who once slept for 12 hours straight. Who hit the bed right after a 2 hour class and who just lazed his days away. This is coming from someone who was in many ways lost and helpless. But here he is making the most he could out of his day academically, socially, software-ly and most importantly he is finally being able to push himself with his willpower.I always had second thoughts whether would I be able to pull off such a commute to college, let alone such a packed schedule. And yet ever since the first day of college, everything has simply fallen into place and seemed natural and effortless (in contrast to being hectic) to me. All of this gives me immense joy and really gives me a feeling of fulfillment. The only thing I wish is to keep the momentum going, to help others along the way and to thank whatever mysterious power is making all this happen to me, in merely a matter of months.</p>`,

    content: `<p>Before you reach the end of the blog, let me just say that today wasn't the most productive day, I might've coded for an hour and thats it, but boy was it a good day. Because of the black coffee I had yesterday morning, I felt super sleepy today morning. I was so sleepy that I was at the brink of bunking college and coming back home, but I pushed myself not to. I pushed myself to be as attentive as possible, and make the most of my time, and surprisingly things paid off well.<br><br>Well for starters, everything that was taught today to us was super interesting and I'm glad I managed to not sleep during any of the lectures. We also interacted with our seniors a lot today, and I could say with a smile that my day was well spent. To top this off I also drove today, for another whopping 70 kilometers and was accompanied with both my dad and mother. They loved the drive as much as I did and I'm just thankful for a safe a smooth drive. In terms of coding I learnt a little bit more about sorting, filling arrays and tried making development work. I know this isn't substantial, but I'll make the most out of tomorrow.</p>`,

    content: `<p>It finally happened, yes this website, my blog page, my lovely pet project which has kept me going this far, IS FINALLY A FULLSTACK WEBSITE. This took so long and so much of head-smacking went into this. I'm probably exaggerating a simple fullstack website, but that doesn't take any of the satisfaction away from me. Being able to take a simple html css page to a fullstack website is really cool and never could I have imagined, when I started this, that one day I'll have a dedicated frontend, backend and database.<br><br>So for context, the foundation of this website was laid on the 19<sup>th</sup> of July. All I remember is that I was super upset with myself, I was troubled and just wanted my mental situation to improve. I did what any other teenager would and started a personal diary, except because I wanted to be cool like Mark Zuckerberg, I decided to host this personal diary as a blog-page on the internet and blog about my coding journey. As an added challenge, I decided to code for a 100 days straight and used this blog page to keep me going.<br><br>That streak has ended once (on the 7th of September) after lasting for 50 days, but that hasn't changed the fact of how I've built this site from scratch, from simple HTML, to moderate CSS, to dynamic doms using Javascript, to finally a fully functional backend connected to a dedicated database! I still remember contemplating (a couple of weeks into the challenge) this course of action. But back then I thought this wasn't my cup of tea and would take very long to pull of. Yet here I am having pulled it off inspite of some inconsistency because of packed schedules.<br><br>I really don't want to use that excuse but it is what it is. What I managed to figure out over 11 days (out of which I worked on this just for 2 hours on 2 separate days) could've easily be finished in under an hour. But that's the learning curve, we all learn at a different pace because we all handle our other priorities differently. This outlook makes me feel so happy. Being able to feel the highs, analyse reality without it letting it affect my happiness and coming up with an unbiased justification is just so beautiful. In many ways its like another fullstack website. One which I have just built, one which really makes me feel ON TOP OF THE WORLD. I'm yet to figure out how to deploy this to the internet, deployment is much like implementation of ideas. All analysis is worthless without implementation just like my dear GLAMAJ has taught me.<br><i>An idea is only as good as the hands executing it.</i></p>`,

    content: `<p>DAY 25 OF 100 BABY and man am I glad the day went the way it did. Yesterday was a big day for me because my blog page was finally a fullstack site (locally) so naturally the next step for me was to figure out how to deploy it. Given how pumped I was, I was almost certain that I'll manage to figure out deployment today, in some ways I did in some I didn't.Being the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of navratri, my mother and I visited the mahalaxmi temple today like we do every year.We also visited a relative's house for the same and all in all this did make the day slightly tiring. Even though the temple was crowded I was happy to be able to say my prayers peacefully.<br><br>Now lets get down to business. So I gave it my all to figure out the deployment of my website, but it just didn't work. Everything I had learnt from previous experience was taken into account, the backend file was in typescript, it was in an api folder, the fetch url was re-defined and a vercel.json file was also intialized. I had even figured out dotenv so everything seemed to be right, but it just didn't work. After all types of permutations and combinations I took a much needed break and tried it all again. Even though it didn't work on the second try it finally clicked (with help from chatgpt), I needed to write a typescript config file. So whenever we use typescript in projects with javascript, nodejs or even by itself, initializing a configuration file is generally good practice. I'm damn sure that this is the only thing I need to fix because even when I deployed my website from scratch the logs gave this very error. Hopefully I'll figure this out tomorrow and by day 26 I'll have a fully deployed full stack application!</p>`,

    content: `<p>What do I say about today, I was super hopeful of figuring out deployment today but once again I couldn't. I shifted the project back from typescript to javascript, after I got fed up with typescript and after getting fed up with Javascript ended up merging the development branch with the production branch. Yes this did affect my  working site's functionality for a bit but I was and still am super bummed about this fact.Every cell inside my body starts retaliating when I can't figure something out or when I lose control of something. <br><br>So imagine what I would be going through having lost complete control over deploying this project and not being able to figure out why. You can even amplify that to whatever degree you like considering that I finally built a fullstack website which couldn't make it to deployment. Anyways that's my stuff to deal with, all I can do is try keeping deployment aside for a while and focus on learning how to code better. At most I'll approach some senior to help me figure this out but other than that I'm done. Here's to shifting my focus back to learning and hopefully figuring this out one day.<br><br>I'm adding ths part after posting the initial blog but I drove again today, and this time I drove my sister!! She wanted to get some things from the stationery shop and when I found out that she was leaving, I pounced on the opportunity to drive her there. This was at 9pm in the night and we were headed to one of the busiest places of chembur. This part of chembur never sleeps and its fair to expect a decent amount of traffic at any given hour of the day let alone 9pm. So not only was I driving my sister, but this would also turn out to be a test of my traffic handling skills. Surprisingly I kept my calm and was able to navigate safely and smoothly at a decent pace too. To top things off today I reverse parked my car, for the very first time in my drive-way. This was and is a big deal to me because my drive-way/parking lot is in a super tricky location. It happens to be the middle lot of 3 lots and its almost impossible to place the car inside in one go. So one has to keep adjusting course by going in and coming out and deal with oncoming traffic at the same time because the parking lot is perpendicular to a road. I managed to pull the parking off that too in reverse which was super satisfactory. So yeah, ups and downs, but I'm here to cherish one and analyse the other while still cherishing my moment!</p>`,

    content: `<p>Looks like I've entered another rough patch. Couldn't get much coding done today other than catching up with one of my weekend Javascript class lectures. The class was an introduction to React, why it's so popular and what are its benefits. To sum things up, React makes dom manipulation easier by handling it all for you. This is done by writing our code as a State (the variables) and the Components (the hardcoded layouts/blueprints). So react will automatically update the State of the Component, if we simply just change the value of a particular state. States are usually stored like objects, much like JSON so pretty familiar ground.<br><br>Today's day was also particularly note-worthy because I came across an inner sentiment for the first time. So basically me and a friend were discussing about how unnecessary vaping and smoking is (in context of college) and I was telling her how I despise it. I went on to tell her of how once someone vaped in front of me and the smoke came in my face and how I coughed straight at them. She found this a bit strange and unnecessary on my part which is when I, without any thought, told her that "I want live long enough to see my grand-daughter get married". This was a completely involuntary response and put me into deep thought. It was something which came to me naturally and the more I thought about it, it seemed like a good enough reason to sacrifice on comfort right now to live those extra few years. Before you start contemplating that I'm thinking on extreme parallels, let me assure you I'm not. Something like this hasn't happened that often with me and I'd like to belive that it did for a reason. So dear reader let me leave you by saying <br><i>"I want to live long enough to attend and dance at my grand-daughter's wedding."</i></p>`,
