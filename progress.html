      <h3>Day 1</h3>
      <p class="content">
        Today marks the start of my 100 days coding challenge. Currently i know
        a little bit of HTML, some bit of Javascript including dom manipulation
        and apis and very litle Java. The website infront of you is an
        implementation of said skills. The biggest problem in learning these
        languages has been consistency.Before I can build a decent foundation in
        one, as soon as I get bored I switch to another comparatively more
        interesting language and hence my skillset includes a bit of everything
        ie: webdev (HTML & JS) and DSA's (Java). However things won't work this
        way. I plan to become consistent and will only switch to learning
        another language no matter how tempting, only once I have finished the
        current one. I brushed up my basics in HTML for todays day and look
        forward to doing the same for sometime before I can start CSS.<br />
        Heres to day 1 and 99 more to come!!!

      <h3>Day 2</h3>
      <p class="content">
        Today marks the second day of the challenge, and I'd say im off to a
        decent start. Today I finished revising everything I had to in HTML and
        started CSS in which I did ID's , classes , combining selectors and some
        other basic stuff. I know I said I will not switch between languages
        quickly but theres only so much one can do in HTML. For the coming week
        I plan to build a good grip over HTML and CSS by studying the two and
        starting projects while constantly updating this one too. Today I
        tweaked with the CSS of the buttons of the website and added delays
        along with borders which make the buttons look simple and clean. Overall
        I'm happy with how the day turned out and look forward to building and
        carrying the momentum ahead. Here's to another productive day!!!
      </p>

      <h3>Day 3</h3>
      <p class="content">
        Today's day was a bit wonky, I dove deep into CSS concepts like Pseudo
        classes, Inheritance, Universal selectors, and some bit of theory
        related to inheritance. I had some trouble in styling hyperlinks
        specifically when I selected the linked anchor elements. As of today I
        haven't been able to solve or understand that problem but will hopefully
        have it resolved it in a couple of days with the help of stackoverflow
        and chatgpt. As far as this website is concerned I'm trying to add dates
        next to the day and also am attempting to make collapsible text boxes.
        That should take sometime given where I am at, but I feel I should be
        able to roll out these updates with dates soon. Other than that its
        another day in the bag and another step closer.

      <h3>Day 4</h3>
      <p class="content">
        Today marks another productive day and was also a pretty fun one. I got
        up early at 6am and was at my table by 7am. I studied the css box model
        today in which I covered both theory and application.The box model also
        helped me in implementing dates on my page which I did using the inline
        box model which was exactly what I needed. I also used chrome's dev
        tools to further understand the box model which was super helpful. What
        made the day fun was meeting my grandma at her club in tardeo and
        spending time with her. The best part was being able to balance work
        with fun and it felt really awarding. So yes I can feel the momentum
        building up and the grind is coming alive!!!

      <h3>Day 5</h3>
      <p class="content">
        Not the day I wanted it to be. I did manage to complete the css box
        model today but I hoped to do more. A big reason for today's outcome was
        not getting up on time in the morning. Apparently waking up early and
        starting on time makes much more of a difference than one anticipates. I
        also stumbled on the fact that I didn't need to create separate classes
        to style my paragraphs and could simply do it all under the pre-existing
        p description box in my css file. Anyways, with the CSS box model done,
        I shall move to layouts tomorrow, hopefully wake up on time and have a
        much more productive day.

      <h3>Day 6</h3>
      <p>
        Another productive day indeed.Today I finally started layouts in CSS
        which included floating layouts. It was a little tricky to wrap my mind
        around, but I feel I have understood most of it. Floating layouts by
        themselves weren't that hard, the tricky part was this trick called
        "clearing floats". So basically if all the elements in a container are
        floating elements, that particular container's height collapses and it's
        float needs to be cleared. Will be starting with flexboxes tomorrow but
        I'll definitely be reviewing today's work tomorrow and making sure I've
        understood everything properly. Also related to the CSS change I made
        yesterday, turns out it wasn't the right choice. It made my landing
        page's paragraphs also inline elements which was not needed. So I
        changed that part of the code but ran into another issue with the dates.
        Apparently if my text goes too close to the dates, the dates get pushed
        down which isn't ideal. I haven't figured out a solution yet, but the
        short term solution is making sure that my daily log texts don't end
        anywhere near the date ðŸ˜…. Will definitely work on this and figure it
        out as soon as possible. Other than that, great day. As Carlos Sainz
        would say, Vamoss!!!!

      <h3>Day 7</h3>
      <p>
        What a day, what a day indeed!!!! I couldn't get much out of the day in
        terms of seeing lectures, but what I did do was apply all that knowledge
        to my webpage. I added a Nav bar, and an About section as well. I did
        all of this using concepts and properties like float and flexbox which I
        learn't on previous days. I mean I did start seeing a lecture today, but
        then I had to go see my grandma who came to Chembur to meet me and my
        sister. We hung out, talked, discussed stuff and had a lot of fun. As
        soon as I came back, instead of resuming my flexbox lectures, I started
        applying that knowledge to my page to implement a Nav Bar and an About
        section. Overall I am very happy with how the results turned out even
        though there is some alignment left to do. Normally I wouldn't get up
        till everything's done, but I need to give the laptop to my sister. What
        a day indeed and lets carry forward this momentum!!.

      <h3>Day 8</h3>
      <p>
        This was a picture perfect day for me. So my day started pretty early at
        12am in the night when I wasn't getting sleep. So I started working on
        aligining the items on my page including the Nav bar elements and the
        About section. Took me some time, but it was sooo rewarding. Soon after
        I proceeded to add the Nav bar to all my pages and doing so was the most
        satisfying part of working on this website. I still need to optimise my
        flexboxes and make the site mobile friendly, but being able to pull this
        off with minimal flexbox knowledge is priceless. I did run into many
        problems which I tried Chat gpt'ing but even that didn't work. So I had
        to eventually figure everything out on my own and it was an amazing
        experience. The day didn't end there though, I was up by 11am and I
        completed my flexbox lectures in the day. They were by far the smoothest
        lectures I have watched, maybe because I worked on the concept myself
        the last night. Today's day was a perfect balance between lectures and
        application and was in all senses picture perfect!!

      <h3>Day 9</h3>
      <p>
        Another super productive day! I wrapped up CSS grids which were super
        simple to use and enabled me to implement 2 dimensional layouts in this
        site with ease. Switching the layout from flexbox to grid was
        frictionless and I was very impressed with how identical the final
        layout turned out to be in comparison to the original one. With layouts
        finished I started with some bit of Web design rules & guidelines in
        which I covered basic typography and color theory slightly. Switching to
        web-design after doing layouts for some time is a slight hiccup, but I'm
        sure that very soon I'll get the hang of it. Here's to another great
        day!!

      <h3>Day 10</h3>
      <p>
        A day I never thought would come. Today I was up by 6am on my own and
        surprisingly I picked up my mechanics textbook and started studying. I
        didn't even realise how quickly those 2 hours passed by and they were
        pretty fun. In mechanics I started with a chapter around resolution of
        vectors, in which we resolve forces into respective components. Doing
        that reminded me a lot about PRI sir, my physics teacher in coaching
        class, who taught us very enthusiastically. Thanks to him I was able to
        surf through previous year questions with ease and had a good time. Then
        I had to go to pick my grandfather up at the train station after which I
        came home. I helped out a fellow with his buggy navbar and fingers
        crossed my solution works. It was related to what I had learn't about
        layouts in CSS and hopefully my solution will work. Why am I writing all
        this down? Because as a consequence of this all combined with my sister
        needing the macbook for her debate, I could barely code today, I mean I
        did do some more color theory and I did help another person in his bugs
        but other than that nothing. So bit of a disappointing day in terms of
        coding, but super productive in terms of being helpful and college
        studies.<br />
        <br />
        Today marks the 10th day of my challenge and todays day didn't go as
        planned for such a milestone given that I didn't think I'd make it this
        far. So after having done HTML and mostly CSS for 10 days straight, from
        tomorrow onwards I plan on starting with JavaScript for atleast an hour
        daily along with the usual CSS.<br />That being said, I'm off the store
        to find the best price I can for my desired laptop!!!
