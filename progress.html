      <h3>Day 1</h3>
      <p>
        Today marks the start of my 100 days coding challenge. Currently i know
        a little bit of HTMl, some bit of Javascript including dom manipulation
        and apis and very litle Java. The website infront of you is an
        implementation of said skills. The biggest problem in learning these
        languages has been consistency.Before I can build a decent foundation in
        one, as soon as I get bored I switch to another comparatively more
        interesting language and hence my skillset includes a bit of everything
        ie: webdev (HTML & JS) and DSA's (Java). However things won't work this
        way. I plan to become consistent and will only switch to learning
        another language no matter how tempting, only once I have finished the
        current one. I brushed up my basics in HTML for todays day and look
        forward to doing the same for sometime before I can start CSS.<br />
        Heres to day 1 and 99 more to come!!!
