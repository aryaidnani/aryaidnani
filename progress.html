      <h3>Day 1</h3>
      <p class="content">
        Today marks the start of my 100 days coding challenge. Currently i know
        a little bit of HTML, some bit of Javascript including dom manipulation
        and apis and very litle Java. The website infront of you is an
        implementation of said skills. The biggest problem in learning these
        languages has been consistency.Before I can build a decent foundation in
        one, as soon as I get bored I switch to another comparatively more
        interesting language and hence my skillset includes a bit of everything
        ie: webdev (HTML & JS) and DSA's (Java). However things won't work this
        way. I plan to become consistent and will only switch to learning
        another language no matter how tempting, only once I have finished the
        current one. I brushed up my basics in HTML for todays day and look
        forward to doing the same for sometime before I can start CSS.<br />
        Heres to day 1 and 99 more to come!!!

      <h3>Day 2</h3>
      <p class="content">
        Today marks the second day of the challenge, and I'd say im off to a
        decent start. Today I finished revising everything I had to in HTML and
        started CSS in which I did ID's , classes , combining selectors and some
        other basic stuff. I know I said I will not switch between languages
        quickly but theres only so much one can do in HTML. For the coming week
        I plan to build a good grip over HTML and CSS by studying the two and
        starting projects while constantly updating this one too. Today I
        tweaked with the CSS of the buttons of the website and added delays
        along with borders which make the buttons look simple and clean. Overall
        I'm happy with how the day turned out and look forward to building and
        carrying the momentum ahead.

      <h3>Day 3</h3>
      <p class="content">
        Today's day was a bit wonky, I dove deep into CSS concepts like Pseudo
        classes, Inheritance, Universal selectors, and some bit of theory
        related to inheritance. I had some trouble in styling hyperlinks
        specifically when I selected the linked anchor elements. As of today I
        haven't been able to solve or understand that problem but will hopefully
        have it resolved it in a couple of days with the help of stackoverflow
        and chatgpt. As far as this website is concerned I'm trying to add dates
        next to the day and also am attempting to make collapsible text boxes.
        That should take sometime given where I am at, but I feel I should be
        able to roll out these updates with dates soon. Other than that its
        another day in the bag and another step closer.

      <h3>Day 4</h3>
      <p class="content">
        Today marks another productive day and was also a pretty fun one. I got
        up early at 6am and was at my table by 7am. I studied the css box model
        today in which I covered both theory and application.The box model also
        helped me in implementing dates on my page which I did using the inline
        box model which was exactly what I needed. I also used chrome's dev
        tools to further understand the box model which was super helpful. What
        made the day fun was meeting my grandma at her club in tardeo and
        spending time with her. The best part was being able to balance work
        with fun and it felt really awarding. So yes I can feel the momentum
        building up and the grind is coming alive!!!

      <h3>Day 5</h3>
      <p class="content">
        Not the day I wanted it to be. I did manage to complete the css box
        model today but I hoped to do more. A big reason for today's outcome was
        not getting up on time in the morning. Apparently waking up early and
        starting on time makes much more of a difference than one anticipates. I
        also stumbled on the fact that I didn't need to create separate classes
        to style my paragraphs and could simply do it all under the pre-existing
        p description box in my css file. Anyways, with the CSS box model done,
        I shall move to layouts tomorrow, hopefully wake up on time and have a
        much more productive day.
