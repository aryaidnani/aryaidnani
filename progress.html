      <h3>Day 1</h3>
      <p>
        Today marks the beginning of my 100 days coding challenge. For the past
        2 months I have been messing around here and there with Java in frankly
        a not so consistent manner. I now plan to start and take coding more
        seriously and what better way to do that than the infamous 100 day
        challenge. Today we started off with basic HTML and I look forward to
        gain a ton of knowledge in the coming 99 days. Heres to day 1!!
